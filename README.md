##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository hosts the R script and documentation files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Used dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, data, and work performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the script that performs the following 5 steps:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`tidy_data.txt` result generated from the script.
